# k8s-mediaserver-operator

Your all-in-one resource for your media needs!

I am so happy to announce the first release of the **k8s-mediaserver-operator**, a project that mixes up some of the
mainstream tools for your media needs.

The Custom Resource that is implemented, allows you to create a fully working and complete media server on #kubernetes,
based on:

[Plex Media Server](https://www.plex.tv/ "Plex Media Server") - A complete and fully funtional mediaserver that allows
you to render in a webUI your movies, TV Series, podcasts, video streams.

[Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/ "Sonarr") - A TV series and show tracker, that allows the integration with download managers
for searching and retrieving TV Series, organizing them, schedule notifications when an episode comes up and much more.

[Radarr](https://radarr.video/ "Radarr") - The same a **Sonarr**, but for movies!

[Jackett](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett "Jackett") - An API interface that keeps easy your life interacting with
trackers for torrents.

[Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/ "Transmission") - A fast, easy and reliable torrent client.

[Sabnzbd](https://sabnzbd.org/ "Sabnzbd") - A free and easy binary newsreader.

All container images used by the operator are from [linuxserver](https://github.com/linuxserver)

- [linuxserver.io](https://www.linuxserver.io/ "linuxserver.io")

Each of the components can be **enabled** or **disabled** if you already have something in place in your lab!

## Introduction

I started working on this project because I was tired of using the 'containerized' version with docker/podman-compose,
and I wanted to experiment a bit both with helm and operators.

It is quite simple to use, and very minimalistic, with customizations that are strictly related to usability and access,
rather than complex customizations, even if, maybe in the future, we could add it!

Each container has its *init container* in order to initialize configurations on the PV before starting the actual pod
and avoid to restart the pods.

## QuickStart

The operator and the CR are already configured with some defaults settings to make you jump and go with it.

All you need is:

- A namespace where you want to put your Custom Resource and all the pods that will spawn
- Being able to provision an RWX PV where to store configurations, downloads, and all related stuff (suggested > 200GB).
  Persistent Volume **or** StorageClasses for dynamically provisioned volumes are **REQUIRED** (See below for NFS)

1. First install the CRD and the operator:

AMD/Intel:
```shell
kubectl apply -f k8s-mediaserver-operator.yml
```

ARM - Raspberry Pi:
```shell
kubectl apply -f k8s-mediaserver-operator-arm64.yml
```

2. Install the custom resource:
```shell
kubectl apply -f k8s-mediaserver.yml
```

In seconds, you will be ready to use your applications!

With default settings, your applications will run in these paths:

| Service      | Link                                           |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Sonarr       | http://k8s-mediaserver.k8s.test/sonarr         |
| Radarr       | http://k8s-mediaserver.k8s.test/radarr         |
| Transmission | http://k8s-mediaserver.k8s.test/transmission   |
| Jackett      | http://k8s-mediaserver.k8s.test/jackett        |
| PLEX         | http://k8s-plex.k8s.test/                      |


### Using a cluster-external NFS server

This assumes that you have a pre-configured NFS server set up on your network that is accessible from all nodes. If it
is not accessible by all nodes, pods will not enter ready state when scheduled on nodes that do not have NFS access.

To add an NFS volume to each resource, create a `my-values.yaml` file and add the below. You should change the `server:`
and `path:` values to match your NFS.

``` yaml
general:
  storage:
    customVolume: true
  volumes:
    nfs:
      server: {SERVER-IP}
      path: /mount/path/on/nfs/server/
```

*Optional:* To use a specific NFS volume for downloads folder, you should add:

``` yaml
general:
  storage:
    customVolume: true
  downloadsVolume:
    nfs:
      server: {SERVER-IP}
      path: /mount/path/on/nfs/server/
```

With this value saved in the top level directory of this repo, running the below will add the resources to your cluster,
under the helm release name `k8s-mediaserver`

``` shell
helm install -f my-values.yaml k8s-mediaserver ./helm-charts/k8s-mediaserver/
```

This is equivalent to running `mount {SERVER-IP}:/mount/path/on/nfs/server ...` in each container, where `...` is
different per resource, as defined in the templates directory (for each resource).
In addition to the above, you should also edit your subpaths so that they when they are appended to your `path:`
specified in `values.yaml`, they map to the directories you intend.

## The mediaserver CR

The CR is quite simple to configure, and I tried to keep the number of parameters low to avoid confusion, but still
letting some customization to fit the resource inside your cluster.
